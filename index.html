<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="assets/images/IMG_0324.jpg" alt= "Picture of Craig">
<p1>My name is Craig Clark and I have taken a large step trying to take on a coding class. Going into this I assumed with my busy schedule this would be difficult bout I have found that this may be the hardest thing I have ever done especially now.
    I'm 37 years old with 2 businesses that both need to have a web devolper on hand so that puts me in this situation. I have found that listeing to the instructor about just going with the flow and alllow the repetivness of the class to guide you to the end is working.

<p2>One of the most interesting things about me is that about 15 years ago I started making all the wrong decisions in life that in most cases would of never allowed this opporunity to happen. On the other hand sometimes i thin k all the bad descions forced me to understand what was actually needed to be able to compete in the real world.</p2>

<p3>I'm really just pryaing that I have this asignment done by th Saturday that its due. When I looked at what the homework was I almost quit te class..(slight joke) but serusly I think if I can complete this 100% I'll be on par at that point.</p3>
